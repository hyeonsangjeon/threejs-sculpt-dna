[![Rotating high-detail procedural Repolis Tree](assets/repolis-tree-hero.gif)](https://hyeonsangjeon.github.io/threejs-sculpt-dna/)

Turn an object reference image into a quality-gated, action-ready procedural Three.js model, then expand that model into a deterministic family of constraint-safe variants.

`threejs-sculpt-dna` is an evidence-gated GitHub Copilot workflow, not a one-click image-to-mesh converter or a manifest-only port. It treats every reconstruction as a versioned production system: semantic topology, action contracts, deterministic variation, browser evidence, and release integrity advance together.

This repository integrates a reviewed source snapshot of the original
[`Three.js-Object-Sculptor-Codex-Plugin`](https://github.com/vinhhien112/Three.js-Object-Sculptor-Codex-Plugin)
modular modeling kernel with **Sculpt DNA**, Coverage Curator, schema-v2
compatibility, SHA-bound pass evidence, production family matrices,
action-ready contracts, and host-integration gates. Exact source provenance is
recorded in [`UPSTREAM.md`](UPSTREAM.md).

> **Canonical repository:** [`hyeonsangjeon/threejs-sculpt-dna`](https://github.com/hyeonsangjeon/threejs-sculpt-dna). GitHub redirects the previous repository name here, but use this canonical path for installs, links, and clones.

**Start here:** [Run the proof](#verified-release-state) · [Install the plugin](#quick-start) · [Run the doctor](#5-minute-reproducible-check) · [Use the reconstruction Skill](skills/object-to-threejs-procedural/SKILL.md) · [Open the live flagships](https://hyeonsangjeon.github.io/threejs-sculpt-dna/) · [Review script safety](SECURITY.md)

### Verified release state

**Stars measure attention; executable gates measure this repository.** Judge the
release by the committed [`capability-proof.json`](capability-proof.json), not
by a popularity counter.

| Verifiable contract | `0.5.1` state |
| --- | --- |
| Combined reconstruction surface | modular v4 kernel + adaptive v3.1 + explicit schema-v2 Sculpt DNA compatibility |
| Python contracts | 274 tests |
| Executable boundary | 40 declared scripts, network disabled |
| Production evidence | 3 artifact manifests; Brick 4/4 and Seoul 4/4 family matrices |
| Public CI | proof, doctor, tests, release evidence, 4 browser builds, capture tests, and dependency audits |

[Read the verified capability matrix](docs/VERIFIED_CAPABILITIES.md) ·
[Audit upstream lineage](UPSTREAM.md) ·
[Use the fair comparison protocol](docs/FAIR_COMPARISON_PROTOCOL.md)

| You provide | The workflow produces |
| --- | --- |
| A reference image or URL, intended use, and target project | Suitability verdict, complexity assessment, versioned `ObjectSculptSpec`, and explicit fidelity limits |
| Browser feedback during locked sculpt passes | Procedural Three.js factory, generated PBR channels, action-ready runtime maps, comparison evidence, and SHA-bound review history |
| Optional bounded art-direction controls | Deterministic Sculpt DNA variants, curated family manifest, regression matrix, and host-integration report |

### 5-minute reproducible check

Clone the canonical repository and run the committed public sample through the same tools used by the production flagships:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyeonsangjeon/threejs-sculpt-dna.git
cd threejs-sculpt-dna

python3 scripts/doctor.py --skip-copilot
```

Expected result: `READY`. The doctor is read-only: it audits every declared
Python executable, plugin manifests, the committed reference/spec, all eight
passes, and the Brick/Seoul production matrices. It does not install, update,
render, or access the network.

<details>
<summary>See the underlying checks</summary>

```bash
python3 scripts/probe_reference_image.py \
  assets/brick-offroad-reference.jpeg

python3 scripts/validate_sculpt_spec.py \
  examples/repolis-tree/object-sculpt-spec.json \
  --strict-quality

python3 scripts/sculpt_pass_orchestrator.py status \
  examples/repolis-tree/object-sculpt-spec.json
```

Expected result: the image probe reports `"technicalSuitability": "pass"`, strict validation prints `PASS`, and the committed flagship reports `currentPass: complete`.

</details>

Then open GitHub Copilot, attach your own reference, and paste:

```text
Use the object-to-threejs-procedural Skill from threejs-sculpt-dna.

Reconstruct this attached reference as a browser-real-time, action-ready
procedural Three.js model. Validate the image, write the assessment and
ObjectSculptSpec, follow the locked sculpt passes, compare browser screenshots,
and keep generated geometry, materials, pivots, sockets, colliders, evidence,
and runtime metadata in the target project. Do not use an imported mesh.
```

## What Makes It Different

- **Sculpt DNA, not random variants.** Named semantic controls vary proportions, material response, palette, and repetition systems while protecting component identity, attachment roots, sockets, fracture groups, and action-ready topology.
- **Coverage Curator, not cherry-picked samples.** A deterministic centroid-extreme plus greedy max-min heuristic selects a broadly separated representative family from a larger constraint-safe candidate pool.
- **Evidence-bound production gates.** Every locked sculpt pass requires browser screenshots, full reference/render comparisons, semantic AI-vision review, and local SHA-256 bindings. Overwritten or stale evidence automatically invalidates production readiness.
- **Deterministic family regression matrix.** Promoted variants and their base are checked in stable asset/viewpoint order with every cell classified as missing, stale, passing, or failing; AI vision remains the final authority.
- **Action-ready by construction.** Stable pivots, sockets, colliders, constraints, detachable groups, and runtime maps are part of the model contract rather than an animation retrofit.
- **Code-native and reproducible.** Flagship factories use procedural geometry, generated independent PBR channels, deterministic capture, measured performance budgets, and zero imported meshes.

## 03 · Flagship: Repolis Living Archive

[Open the interactive Repolis Tree demo](https://hyeonsangjeon.github.io/threejs-sculpt-dna/)

<sub>Built and visually reviewed with GitHub Copilot · GPT-5.6 Sol.</sub>

The final flagship is generated entirely with code: **0 imported meshes**, approximately **100ms generation**, **17,761 branch vertices**, **2,600 instanced leaves**, **220 moss instances**, and **72 branch-following code glyphs** in the Golden Canopy configuration.

![Repolis Living Archive interactive hero screen](assets/repolis-tree-hero.png)

The interactive page imports the same reusable output intended for the Repolis application:

- [Repolis production factory](examples/repolis-hero/repolis-output/createRepolisHero.js)
- [TypeScript declarations](examples/repolis-hero/repolis-output/createRepolisHero.d.ts)
- [Runtime profile](examples/repolis-hero/repolis-output/repolis-hero-profile.json)
- [Pass-by-pass visual evidence](examples/repolis-hero/evidence/)

## How It Was Built

**01 Reference** → **02 Sculpt DNA variants** → **03 Flagship above**

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>01 · Reference</th>
    <th>02 · Sculpt DNA variants — intermediate</th>
    <th>03 · Flagship — final</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/repolis-tree-reference.jpeg" alt="Gemini-generated Repolis Tree reference"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/repolis-tree-sculpt-dna-result.png" alt="Three intermediate procedural Repolis Tree Sculpt DNA variants"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/repolis-tree-hero.png" alt="Final Repolis Living Archive flagship render"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The reference establishes the identity contract: monumental Y-shaped trunk, gold energy network, amber/cyan canopy, constellation ornaments, and a luminous night landmark.

The middle contact sheet is design-space exploration, not the finished asset. Coverage Curator generated 24 constraint-safe candidates and selected three broadly separated variants while preserving component IDs, parent links, sockets, attachment roots, and review targets. The flagship above then received object-specific geometry, PBR, lighting, camera, interaction, optimization, and eight evidence-backed sculpt-pass reviews.

## Quick Start

1. Register the marketplace and install the plugin:

   ```bash
   copilot plugin marketplace add \
     hyeonsangjeon/threejs-sculpt-dna

   copilot plugin install \
     threejs-sculpt-dna@threejs-copilot-plugins
   ```

2. Start a new GitHub Copilot session and verify `/skills list` includes:
   - `object-to-threejs-procedural`
   - `sculpt-dna-variants`

3. Attach a reference image and ask Copilot to reconstruct it:

   ```text
   Use Three.js Sculpt DNA for GitHub Copilot.

   Reconstruct this attached reference as a browser-real-time, action-ready
   procedural Three.js model. Follow the locked sculpt passes, review browser
   screenshots, then curate 3 representative variants from 24 safe candidates.
   Do not use an imported mesh.
   ```

## Additional Demo Families

Brick and Seoul are now evidence-backed production flagships. Every generated variant resets inherited evidence and must pass a fresh SHA-bound visual review before promotion.

### Brick Off-Road Explorer

[Open the interactive Brick Off-Road Explorer](https://hyeonsangjeon.github.io/threejs-sculpt-dna/brick/)

**Reference** → **Sculpt DNA variants** → **Flagship**

![Rotating procedural Brick Off-Road Explorer](assets/brick-offroad-hero.gif)

    <td><img src="assets/brick-offroad-hero.png" alt="Final Brick Off-Road Explorer flagship render"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The final hard-surface flagship preserves exactly four correctly oriented wheels, the photographed olive hood/cabin/rear-body proportions, light roof, black structure, glazing, arches, suspension, tire treads, studs, fasteners, roof cargo, lamps, and warm recovery hardware. Its three curated configurations complete the base-sculpt and per-variant visual gates while preserving action-ready topology.

The committed installed-Chrome manifest records per-run generation timings plus **63,564–68,324 instance-weighted geometry triangles**, **126 scene drawables**, **387 full-frame WebGL calls** including shadow/transmission/output passes, **512px independent PBR channels**, and **0 imported meshes**.

### Seoul Palace Scene Challenge

[Open the interactive Seoul Palace Scene](https://hyeonsangjeon.github.io/threejs-sculpt-dna/seoul/)

**Reference** → **Intermediate preview** → **Flagship**

![Cinematic procedural Seoul Palace Scene](assets/seoul-palace-hero.gif)

<sub>Built and visually reviewed with GitHub Copilot · GPT-5.6 Sol.</sub>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>01 · Reference crop</th>
    <th>02 · Existing intermediate preview</th>
    <th>03 · Production flagship</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/seoul-challenge-reference.jpeg" alt="User-selected Seoul palace and city challenge crop"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/seoul-challenge-sculpt-dna-result.png" alt="Earlier intermediate layered Seoul palace scene variants"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/seoul-palace-hero.png" alt="Final production procedural Seoul Palace Scene"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

This remains deliberately a **conditional stylized reconstruction** from one low-resolution aerial image, not photogrammetry or an exact reverse-engineered palace. The production flagship now completes all eight locked passes and reads as an axial campus with outer and inner gates, a main throne hall, curved Korean roof rhythm, broad ceremonial courts, side corridors, tree and city belts, and a custom asymmetric ridge skyline.

The installed-Chrome manifest records **144,472 instance-weighted triangles**, **194 scene drawables**, **388 full-frame WebGL calls**, **2,275 instances**, **35 independent 1024px texture fields**, one directional shadow map, and **0 imported meshes**. The canonical 1200×675 capture is byte-identical across repeated runs. Three fresh evidence-backed variants were curated from 24 candidates with a 0.506961 coverage score while locking the palace axis, gate order, main-hall and roof topology, sockets, pivots, reference camera, and colliders.

The two camera photos are stored as web-sized JPEGs with GPS, device, and original capture metadata removed.

Run the interactive showcase locally:

```bash

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/?scene=tree`, replacing `tree` with `brick` or `seoul`.

## At A Glance

- **Plugin:** `threejs-sculpt-dna`
- **Skills:** `object-to-threejs-procedural` and `sculpt-dna-variants`
- **Input:** an attached object image, reference screenshot, or local image path
- **Output:** a procedural Three.js factory, versioned `ObjectSculptSpec`, deterministic variant family, visual review evidence, and optional host render-integration report
- **Best for:** real-time props, hard-surface objects, botanical landmarks, product studies, and explicitly layered scene approximations
- **Not for:** photogrammetry, exact mesh extraction, or guaranteed hidden-side reconstruction from one image

## What It Produces

- An image suitability verdict with explicit uncertainty.
- A pre-spec complexity assessment and object-specific quality contract.
- An `ObjectSculptSpec` describing geometry, materials, evidence, hierarchy, pivots, sockets, colliders, and destruction intent.
- A pass-gated TypeScript Three.js factory with generated PBR maps and look-dev lighting.
- Reference/render comparison sheets and structured AI-vision review history.
- Deterministic Sculpt DNA variant specs with mutation provenance and semantic invariant checks.
- Coverage-curated representative families selected from larger safe candidate pools.
- Versioned standalone/host render snapshots and deterministic integration checks.

It is a code-native reconstruction workflow, not photogrammetry or exact mesh extraction.

## Why High-Detail Results Take Multiple Passes

The skill is a disciplined construction workflow, not a one-click detail filter. High-detail procedural assets come from combining:

- custom curve-swept geometry with taper, bends, multi-frequency deformation, and enough radial/longitudinal segments for the hero silhouette
- hierarchical macro, secondary, tertiary, and fine components rather than one trunk or shell mesh
- deterministic instancing for leaves, studs, treads, moss, lights, trees, buildings, and other repeated systems
- independent albedo, roughness, height, normal, and AO channels plus object-specific local overrides
- small identity details such as branch collars, end grain, sockets, roof tiers, ground contacts, wear, and ornaments
- browser screenshot review and AI-vision correction after every locked sculpt pass
- batching, instancing, and LOD only after the visual identity has passed

The generated factory is therefore a pass-gated scaffold. Hero quality still requires object-specific form, material, lighting, and optimization work.

Our extension adds a second problem-solving layer: after those detailed assets define a safe semantic design space, **Coverage Curator** greedily broadens parameter-space coverage without changing topology, attachments, action-ready hierarchy, or visual review targets.

## Original Sculpt DNA Idea

A single reconstructed object is useful; a reusable asset family is more valuable. Sculpt DNA turns carefully selected spec fields into named controls such as:

- body width, height, depth, taper, or bevel radius
- appendage length or radius while preserving the attachment root
- repetition count or density
- material roughness and surface age
- dominant procedural palette choices

Each parameter has a range or choice set, sampling distribution, semantic purpose, and optional coupling group. Constraints reject invalid combinations. Built-in invariants prevent variants from changing the model's semantic topology:

- component IDs and parent links
- material IDs and component material references
- socket IDs and fracture groups
- attachment parent/root sockets and `localStart`
- build-pass order and feature-review target IDs
- repetition-system IDs

Every generated variant receives a reproducible seed and mutation log. Existing screenshots and pass approvals are cleared because changed geometry or materials must earn fresh visual acceptance.

For a representative family rather than a raw batch:

```bash
python3 scripts/sculpt_dna.py curate object-sculpt-spec.json \
  --out-dir curated \
  --count 3 \
  --pool-size 24 \
  --seed 1337
```

## Technology Analysis

| Layer | Technology | Why it is used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Copilot packaging | Root `plugin.json`, skill directories, `SKILL.md` YAML frontmatter | Native GitHub Copilot plugin discovery and task-triggered instructions |
| Agent workflow | Markdown skills and focused reference documents | Keeps visual reasoning, quality gates, and implementation policy readable and editable |
| Data contracts | Versioned JSON `ObjectSculptSpec` plus additive render integration contract/snapshots | Separates observed design intent from generated renderer objects, then verifies that host integration preserves the accepted runtime assumptions |
| Automation | Python 3.10+ standard library | Portable CLIs with no mandatory package installation |
| CLI surface | `argparse`, `pathlib`, `json` | Predictable file-oriented commands and machine-readable output |
| Image probing | Binary header parsing with `struct` | Reads PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, and BMP dimensions without Pillow |
| PNG/PBR processing | `zlib`, `struct`, `math`, custom RGB/RGBA PNG reader/writer | Generates albedo, roughness, height, normal, and AO evidence without Python image dependencies |
| Non-PNG fallback | macOS `sips`, detected with `shutil.which` | Converts source images when direct PNG decoding is unavailable; other platforms should provide RGB/RGBA PNG input |
| Three.js generation | Python source generator emitting TypeScript | Produces plain Three.js factories that can be hand-refined in an existing application |
| Geometry | Shared validation/generation registry for primitives, assemblies, curves, sweeps, lathes, extrusions, lofts, fitted shells, branches, scatter, instancing, modifiers, sculpted surfaces, and specialized regions | Rejects unsupported geometry instead of silently substituting boxes and keeps complex procedural shapes explicit |
| Materials | `MeshPhysicalMaterial`, emissive controls, deterministic Canvas textures, independent PBR channels | Keeps bark readable beneath glow, avoids flat-color placeholders, and prevents albedo reuse across unrelated PBR channels |
| Runtime structure | `THREE.Group` pivots plus `userData.sculptRuntime` maps | Keeps nodes, meshes, sockets, collider proxies, and destruction groups addressable for animation and physics |
| Visual QA | Browser screenshots, custom comparison sheets, semantic feature gates | Makes visual evidence—not code inspection—the acceptance authority |
| Integration QA | Deterministic renderer/target/layer/view/performance snapshots | Detects host-only rendering regressions without adding a browser runtime dependency or manufacturing an AI pass |
| Variant engine | `copy`, SHA-256 seed derivation, `random.Random`, rejection sampling | Creates reproducible variants and retries samples until constraints pass |
| Verification | `unittest`, `tempfile`, `subprocess`, `compileall` | Tests both Python APIs and end-to-end CLI/factory generation without third-party test tools |

### Dependency Model

The plugin itself has no required PyPI or npm dependencies. Python scripts operate on JSON and images; generated TypeScript expects the target application to already depend on `three`.

The browser, TypeScript compiler, bundler, and Three.js version belong to the target project. The plugin intentionally does not install Playwright or Chromium solely for screenshots.

## Workflow, Script by Script

| --- | --- |
| `doctor.py` | Run the read-only first-clone health check, including plugin, policy, sample, runtime, duplicate-install, and production-matrix status |
| `audit_script_policy.py` | Compare every Python executable with the network-disabled trust inventory in `script-policy.json` |
| `verify_capability_proof.py` | Bind release metadata, upstream provenance, capability claims, evidence files, tests, production matrices, and public CI into one read-only proof |
| `sculpt.py` | Provide the unified command surface for the adaptive modular workflow |
| `sculpt_manifest.py` / `sculpt_modules.py` | Manage v4 root manifests and independently authored module specs |
| `sculpt_geometry.py` | Share the supported procedural geometry registry between validation and TypeScript generation |
| `sculpt_module_state.py` / `sculpt_module_review.py` | Enforce module reuse, correction batches, multi-view evidence, critical-feature vetoes, and build/runtime receipts |
| `probe_reference_image.py` | Detect image format, dimensions, aspect ratio, and basic technical risks |
| `new_pre_spec_assessment.py` | Create a complexity assessment and minimum quality contract |
| `new_sculpt_spec.py` | Create the versioned `ObjectSculptSpec` skeleton |
| `validate_sculpt_spec.py` | Validate structure, references, quality depth, action readiness, PBR intent, pass state, and Sculpt DNA |

| `generate_threejs_factory.py` | Emit the unlocked TypeScript Three.js factory and look-dev lights |
| `extract_reference_pbr.py` | Infer reference-derived PBR evidence and enforce a confidence threshold |
| `make_visual_comparison_sheet.py` | Package reference and render into one AI-reviewable PNG |
| `visual_feature_gate.py` | Enforce critical and important semantic feature thresholds |
| `append_sculpt_review.py` | Record AI-vision scores, mismatches, evidence, and correction decisions |
| `sculpt_dna.py` | Initialize, validate, and generate deterministic constraint-safe variants |
| `sculpt_dna_core.py` | Shared DNA schema, target resolver, constraints, invariants, sampling, and provenance |

## Requirements

- GitHub Copilot with plugin support.
- Python 3.10 or newer.
- A Three.js browser project for generated model implementation.
- A rendered screenshot and AI-vision review for visual acceptance.

For non-PNG source images on platforms without macOS `sips`, convert the input to an RGB/RGBA PNG before PBR extraction or comparison-sheet generation.

## Install

Use exactly one installation source. The repository marketplace is the
recommended and tested path:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add \
  hyeonsangjeon/threejs-sculpt-dna

copilot plugin install \
  threejs-sculpt-dna@threejs-copilot-plugins

copilot plugin list
```

GitHub Copilot plugin marketplaces are decentralized repositories rather than a single approval-based catalog. The checked-in `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` makes this repository a supported marketplace source.

Do not also install the same plugin from a local path or direct repository URL.
Duplicate cached copies can shadow one another and make upgrades appear stale.
From a cloned checkout, `python3 scripts/doctor.py` warns when it detects more
than one `threejs-sculpt-dna` installation.

<details>
<summary>Local contributor install</summary>

Use this only while developing the plugin, and remove the marketplace copy
first:

```bash
copilot plugin install "$(pwd)"
copilot plugin list
```

Direct repository installs still work in current Copilot CLI builds but emit a
marketplace-migration warning, so they are not the recommended onboarding path.

</details>

Start a new Copilot CLI session, then verify the skills:

```text
/skills list
```

Copilot caches installed plugins. Contributors using the local-only mode should
reinstall that path after modifying the plugin:

```bash
copilot plugin install "$(pwd)"
```

See GitHub's [plugin authoring guide](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/plugins-creating) and [CLI plugin reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-plugin-reference).

## Base Reconstruction Quick Start

Probe the image:

```bash
python3 scripts/probe_reference_image.py ./reference/object.png
```

Create an assessment and spec:

```bash
python3 scripts/new_pre_spec_assessment.py "Reference Object" \
  --image ./reference/object.png \
  --complexity moderate \
  --out assessment.json

python3 scripts/new_sculpt_spec.py "Reference Object" \
  --image ./reference/object.png \
  --assessment assessment.json \
  --out object-sculpt-spec.json
```

Complete the observed fields and quality contract, then validate:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_sculpt_spec.py object-sculpt-spec.json
python3 scripts/validate_sculpt_spec.py object-sculpt-spec.json --strict-quality
```

Check the unlocked pass and generate its factory:

```bash
python3 scripts/sculpt_pass_orchestrator.py status object-sculpt-spec.json
python3 scripts/generate_threejs_factory.py object-sculpt-spec.json \
  --out src/createReferenceObjectModel.ts
```

Render the model, capture a screenshot, and create the review artifact:

```bash
python3 scripts/make_visual_comparison_sheet.py \
  --reference ./reference/object.png \
  --render ./screenshots/object-render.png \
  --out ./screenshots/object-comparison.png \
  --json
```

After AI-vision review, record the pass:

```bash
python3 scripts/append_sculpt_review.py object-sculpt-spec.json \
  --pass-id blockout \
  --fidelity 0.82 \
  --action continue \
  --summary "Silhouette and primary proportions meet the blockout gate." \
  --render-screenshot ./screenshots/object-render.png \
  --comparison-image ./screenshots/object-comparison.png \
  --ai-vision-score 0.82 \
  --layer-scores-json '{"silhouetteProportion":0.84,"componentStructure":0.81,"formDetail":0.76,"materialSurface":0.72,"lightingCamera":0.8}' \
  --feature-reviews-json ./reviews/blockout-features.json \
  --ai-vision-notes "Primary shape passes; meso detail remains deferred." \
  --in-place
```

Repeat the locked render, comparison, review, and pipeline-sync loop for `structural-pass`, `form-refinement`, `material-pass`, and `surface-pass`. Production Sculpt DNA generation intentionally remains blocked until evidence-backed `reviewHistory` completes that sequence.

`append_sculpt_review.py` SHA-256-binds every local reference, render, and
comparison file. Pipeline sync, strict validation, and production variant
generation recompute those hashes, so overwriting a reviewed capture invalidates
the pass. URL, data, blob, and session-artifact evidence is retained as
`remote-unverified` record-only evidence and cannot complete a production pass.

## Sculpt DNA Quick Start

Initialize conservative starter controls:

```bash
python3 scripts/sculpt_dna.py init object-sculpt-spec.json --in-place
```

Edit `sculptDNA.parameters` into object-specific controls, then validate both layers:

```bash
python3 scripts/sculpt_dna.py validate object-sculpt-spec.json
python3 scripts/validate_sculpt_spec.py object-sculpt-spec.json
```

After the base sculpt has completed through `surface-pass`, generate eight production variants:

```bash
python3 scripts/sculpt_dna.py generate object-sculpt-spec.json \
  --out-dir ./variants \
  --count 8 \
  --seed 1337
```

For an early, explicitly non-promotable design-space contact sheet, add `--preview`. Preview provenance records the missing base passes and keeps every result blocked pending its own visual review:

```bash
python3 scripts/sculpt_dna.py curate object-sculpt-spec.json \
  --out-dir ./preview-variants \
  --count 3 \
  --pool-size 24 \
  --seed 1337 \
  --preview
```

The output directory contains:

```text
variants/
├── <target-id>-v001.json
├── <target-id>-v002.json
├── ...
└── sculpt-dna-manifest.json
```

Each variant can enter the normal pass-gated factory and screenshot workflow:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_sculpt_spec.py variants/<target-id>-v001.json
python3 scripts/generate_threejs_factory.py variants/<target-id>-v001.json \
  --out src/createSelectedVariantModel.ts
```

### Deterministic visual regression matrix

Add the optional `visualRegressionMatrix` v1 block to the curated manifest to
name required viewpoints, bind each one to an authoritative pass, record
expected render/comparison path templates, and select semantic feature reviews.
Then verify the base plus every promoted variant:

```bash
python3 scripts/visual_regression_matrix.py \
  object-sculpt-spec.json \
  variants/sculpt-dna-manifest.json \
  --out variants/visual-regression-report.json \
  --summary
```

For a one-off run without manifest configuration, repeat
`--viewpoint VIEWPOINT_ID=PASS_ID`. The report is deterministic: base first,
variant IDs and viewpoint IDs sorted, and summary keys ordered as `missing`,
`stale`, `passing`, `failing`. Exit status is `0` only when every cell passes,
`1` for a complete but non-passing matrix, and `2` for invalid input.

The matrix reuses strict local SHA-256 evidence checks, latest-per-pass review
selection, sculpt-pass completion, layer thresholds, and semantic feature
gates. It never converts pixel metrics into visual approval. See the
[manifest, report, and additive migration schema](skills/sculpt-dna-variants/references/visual-regression-matrix.md).

## Verify a model inside a host app

A standalone turntable can look correct because rotation eventually reveals
every emissive branch. A host app can still hide that branch from a fixed
camera, exclude it from a selective bloom layer, place an oversized occlusion
proxy in front of it, add a second output transform, or let hero lights spill
into the town. Verify the exact standalone and host configurations after
optimization and before production acceptance.

Create three JSON files:

1. `render-integration-contract.json` — stable IDs, renderer policy, required
   targets/layers/lights/views/semantics, and budgets.
2. `standalone-snapshot.json` — telemetry captured from the accepted standalone
   scene.
3. `host-snapshot.json` — the same telemetry captured inside the host app.

Run the three-angle deterministic demonstration directly from the repository
root. Its values are explicitly illustrative demonstration data, not claimed
live measurements:

```bash
python3 scripts/render_integration_contract.py \
  examples/render-integration-contract/render-integration-contract.json \
  examples/render-integration-contract/standalone-snapshot.json \
  examples/render-integration-contract/host-snapshot.json \
  --out /tmp/integration-report.json \
  --summary
```

The sample exits `0` and prints this summary to stderr; the full JSON is written
to `/tmp/integration-report.json`:

```text
PASS
checks: total=211 missing=0 stale=0 passing=211 failing=0
```

Exit `1` means the inputs were valid but at least one check is `missing`,
`stale`, or `failing`. Exit `2` means malformed, unsafe, non-finite,
unsupported-schema, or identity-inconsistent input. Without `--out`, the JSON
report is printed to stdout.

- `tone-mapping-count`: the host usually added a second `OutputPass` or nested
  composer; keep exactly one output transform.
- `town-light-spill`: a declared hero light targets the town layer or its
  measured town contribution exceeds the contract; fix light ownership/layers.
- `view-coverage`: a fixed host camera, layer mask, clipping plane, or occlusion
  proxy pushed the hero/view coverage outside its declared range.

Coverage and luminance are diagnostic gates. A passing integration report does
not approve visual quality; AI vision remains the final visual authority. See
the [full v1 schema and browser probe guide](skills/object-to-threejs-procedural/references/render-integration-contract.md)
and the committed
[`browser-snapshot-helper.js`](examples/render-integration-contract/browser-snapshot-helper.js).

## Quality Gates

The workflow blocks progress when:

- the reference does not expose enough silhouette or depth information
- the quality contract is too generic for the object
- component hierarchy or attachment contracts are too shallow
- material response is flat, aliased across PBR channels, or unsupported by source evidence
- a future build pass is requested before the current pass receives visual approval
- the global visual score is acceptable but a critical semantic feature fails
- Sculpt DNA targets protected semantic fields
- a variant violates declared constraints or invariants
- a promoted base/variant viewpoint cell is missing, stale, or rejected by AI-vision layer or semantic gates
- a host integration contract reports stale bindings, missing runtime telemetry, renderer/layer/view drift, performance regressions, or runtime errors

## Test

```bash
python3 -m compileall -q scripts tests
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The test suite covers DNA derivation, schema validation, immutable-target rejection, deterministic generation, evidence reset, manifest output, matrix ordering/classification/latest-review precedence, render-integration safety/classification/cwd determinism, generated TypeScript metadata, release-image dimensions, file-size budgets, EXIF removal, and inherited-asset exclusion.

## Limitations

- One image cannot reveal exact hidden geometry or manufacturing dimensions.
- PBR extraction is evidence-driven inference, not exact inverse rendering.
- Transparent glass, smoke, liquids, fur, and fine cloth may require more references or a reduced target.
- Complex generated primitives such as lathe, tube, curve sweep, extrude, and instanced clusters still require object-specific hand refinement.
- Variant constraints protect declared semantics, but visual acceptance still requires fresh browser evidence.
