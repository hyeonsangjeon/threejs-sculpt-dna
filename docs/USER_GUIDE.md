# threejs-sculpt-dna — A GitHub Copilot Plugin: User Guide

## 1. Install from the Copilot plugin marketplace

Choose this marketplace installation as the single active copy. Installing the
same plugin again from a local path or direct repository URL can leave multiple
cached copies that shadow one another.

Register this repository as a marketplace:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add \
  hyeonsangjeon/threejs-sculpt-dna
```

Browse the registered plugin:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace browse threejs-copilot-plugins
```

Install it:

```bash
copilot plugin install \
  threejs-sculpt-dna@threejs-copilot-plugins
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
copilot plugin list
```

Start a new Copilot session and check the available skills:

```text
/skills list
```

You should see:

- `object-to-threejs-procedural`
- `sculpt-dna-variants`

GitHub Copilot plugin marketplaces are decentralized Git repositories. The file `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` registers this repository as the `threejs-copilot-plugins` marketplace.

If you cloned the repository, run the complete offline release proof:

```bash
python3 scripts/prove.py
```

`PROOF PASS: 6/6 checks passed` means executable policy, capability contract,
first-clone health, Python compilation/contracts, and release evidence all
pass. The runner never accesses the network and writes nothing unless
`--output` explicitly names a proof JSON file. Run
`python3 scripts/doctor.py` separately when diagnosing optional runtime gaps or
duplicate Copilot installations.

## 2. Attach a reference image

In GitHub Copilot:

1. Open the project where the Three.js output should be created.
2. Attach or drag an object reference image into the prompt.
3. Describe the intended use: browser prop, hero render, game object, articulated asset, or destructible object.
4. Ask Copilot to use the installed skills.

## 3. Recommended prompts

### Build one procedural object

```text
Use Three.js Sculpt DNA for GitHub Copilot.

Reconstruct the object in this attached image as a browser-real-time,
action-ready procedural Three.js model.

Follow the locked workflow:
reference validation -> complexity assessment -> ObjectSculptSpec ->
blockout -> structure -> form -> materials -> surface details ->
browser screenshots and AI-vision correction.

Keep stable pivots, sockets, colliders, and destruction groups.
Do not use an imported mesh.
```

### Generate a representative variant family

Use this only after the base sculpt has completed through `surface-pass`:

```text
Use sculpt-dna-variants on the completed ObjectSculptSpec.

Define bounded semantic controls, preserve all topology and action-ready
invariants, generate 24 safe deterministic candidates, and use Coverage
Curator to select 3 broadly separated variants.

Render every selected variant from the same camera and keep each one blocked
until it receives fresh visual review.
```

### Early design preview

```text
Create a non-promotable Sculpt DNA preview family from this strict spec.
Mark it as preview mode, list the missing base passes, and do not describe
the variants as production-ready.
```

### Flagship-quality result

```text
Choose the strongest curated variant and art-direct it as the flagship.

Increase object-specific curve geometry, hierarchy depth, generated PBR,
instanced detail, lighting, camera, interaction, and optimization quality.
Capture pass-by-pass evidence and save the reusable production factory
separately from the demo page.
```

### Verify the flagship inside a host app

```text
After optimization, create a Render Integration Contract v1 for this asset.
Capture JSON snapshots from both the accepted standalone scene and the real
host app using the same fixed named cameras.

Gate tone mapping, output color space/pass count, exposure, DPR and render
targets, selective layers/lights, town spill, semantic coverage/luminance,
black/clipped frames, town exposure, calls/triangles/frame time/FPS, and
console/network errors. Do not treat diagnostic metrics as AI visual approval.
```

## 4. What Copilot should do

The installed workflow should:

1. Reject or qualify unsuitable references.
2. Estimate complexity before implementation.
3. Decompose silhouette, structural components, materials, and surface details.
4. Build in locked passes instead of jumping directly to a polished mesh.
5. Compare browser renders with the reference and self-correct.
6. Preserve pivots, sockets, colliders, hierarchy, and destruction metadata.
7. Reset review evidence whenever a variant changes visible geometry or materials.
8. Use Coverage Curator for representative families instead of taking the first random samples.
9. Verify optimized host/app targets against standalone behavior before production acceptance.

Review history uses the latest entry for each pass as authoritative, so a stale
superseded review cannot override a newer decision. Specs without
`reviewPolicy` retain legacy local-path checks. Upgrade them to policy v2 with
`python3 scripts/migrate_review_policy.py object-sculpt-spec.json --in-place`.
Policy-v2 production reviews require local render and comparison files; all
gates recompute their SHA-256 digests, and changed pixels invalidate completion.
Remote or virtual evidence remains record-only.

Promoted families can add the manifest-only `visualRegressionMatrix` v1 block
to define fixed viewpoints, pass bindings, expected render/comparison paths,
and selected semantic targets. This is additive: no `ObjectSculptSpec` field is
changed. The matrix verifies current reviews but does not render images or
replace AI vision.

Host/app targets use separate additive `render-integration-contract` and
`render-runtime-snapshot` v1 documents. They do not add fields to
`ObjectSculptSpec` or existing reviews. The host gate compares exact renderer
state and explicit tolerances/budgets; it has no wildcard ignore list. A
standalone rotating camera can hide a fixed host-camera, layer, or occlusion
bug, so capture every required named view in both environments.

## 5. Useful commands

Validate a spec:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_sculpt_spec.py object-sculpt-spec.json --strict-quality
```

Check the active sculpt pass:

```bash
python3 scripts/sculpt_pass_orchestrator.py status object-sculpt-spec.json
```

Generate production variants after the evidence-backed base gate:

```bash
python3 scripts/sculpt_dna.py curate object-sculpt-spec.json \
  --out-dir variants \
  --count 3 \
  --pool-size 24 \
  --seed 1337
```

Generate an explicitly non-promotable preview:

```bash
python3 scripts/sculpt_dna.py curate object-sculpt-spec.json \
  --out-dir preview-variants \
  --count 3 \
  --pool-size 24 \
  --seed 1337 \
  --preview
```

Verify every required viewpoint for the base and promoted family:

```bash
python3 scripts/visual_regression_matrix.py \
  object-sculpt-spec.json \
  variants/sculpt-dna-manifest.json \
  --out variants/visual-regression-report.json \
  --summary
```

Without a manifest block, pass one or more
`--viewpoint VIEWPOINT_ID=PASS_ID` options. Exit `0` means every cell passes;
exit `1` means the deterministic report contains missing, stale, or failing
cells; exit `2` means the inputs are invalid. JSON remains on stdout or in
`--out`, while `--summary` writes human-readable output to stderr. See the
[matrix schema and migration note](../skills/sculpt-dna-variants/references/visual-regression-matrix.md).

Verify an optimized model inside its host app:

```bash
python3 scripts/render_integration_contract.py \
  render-integration-contract.json \
  standalone-snapshot.json \
  host-snapshot.json \
  --out integration-report.json \
  --summary
```

Exit `0` means all required integration checks pass. Exit `1` means the valid
report contains missing, stale, or failing checks. Exit `2` means malformed,
unsafe, non-finite, unsupported-schema, or identity-inconsistent input.
Coverage and luminance remain diagnostic only; AI vision is final authority.
See the
[full contract, snapshot, report, and browser probe guide](../skills/object-to-threejs-procedural/references/render-integration-contract.md).

## 6. Update or uninstall

Update:

```bash
copilot plugin update threejs-sculpt-dna
```

Uninstall:

```bash
copilot plugin uninstall threejs-sculpt-dna
```

Remove the marketplace:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace remove threejs-copilot-plugins
```

Use `--force` only when you also want to uninstall plugins installed from that marketplace.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Multiple copies or stale skills appear

Run:

```bash
copilot plugin list
python3 scripts/doctor.py
```

Keep exactly one `threejs-sculpt-dna` installation, preferably
`threejs-sculpt-dna@threejs-copilot-plugins`, remove the other source, and start
a new Copilot session. Do not use `--force` until you have identified which
marketplace owns the copy you intend to remove.

### Marketplace is already registered from another source

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace remove threejs-copilot-plugins --force
copilot plugin marketplace add \
  hyeonsangjeon/threejs-sculpt-dna
```

Then reinstall the plugin.

### Skills do not appear

Start a new Copilot session after installation and run `/skills list`.

### Production variant generation is blocked

This is intentional. Complete evidence-backed reviews through `surface-pass`, ensure the screenshot and comparison files still exist, then sync the pipeline:

```bash
python3 scripts/sculpt_pass_orchestrator.py sync object-sculpt-spec.json --in-place
```

### The visual regression matrix exits 1

Inspect each non-passing cell. Capture missing named viewpoints, restore or
re-review stale SHA/path/camera bindings, and fix failed global, layer, or
semantic AI-vision scores. Pixel metrics may help diagnose a mismatch but
cannot approve the cell.

### The host integration contract exits 1

Inspect `checks` in stable report order. `tone-mapping-count` usually means a
host composer added a second `OutputPass`; `town-light-spill` means a
hero-owned light reaches the town layer or exceeds its contribution limit; and
`view-coverage` usually points to the fixed camera, clipping, layer masks, or an
oversized occlusion proxy. Recapture both snapshots after fixing the host.

If the contract exits `2`, fix the JSON/schema/path/SHA/identity error first.
Do not convert it to an allowed difference. Host-specific differences must fit
an explicit contract value, range, delta, or budget.

### The reference is a crowded scene

Select one target object or explicitly accept a layered scene approximation. Do not claim exact hidden geometry from one image.
